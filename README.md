# Terminal-Based-TicTacToe-Game

## Introduction

## Features
* Two players can play against each other.
* The game displays the current state of the board after each move.
* The game announces the winner or declares a draw when the game ends.
* The Symbol is chosen randomly for players to maintain fairness as 'X' always starts first.

## Rules
+ The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
+ Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
+ The game ends when a player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), making them the winner.
+ If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
